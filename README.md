# Automated-Pet-Door-Using-Arduino
This guide will walk you through building an automated pet door using an Arduino Uno, RFID reader, and servo motor. The system unlocks the door when a registered RFID tag (e.g., attached to a pet's collar) is detected, ensuring only authorized pets can enter or exit. This project is ideal for enhancing pet safety and convenience.
